// TWO STICKS AND A LIGHTER
// You are confined in a room with only two sticks and a lighter. You know that each stick will take exactly 1 hour to burn up but the rate at which each stick burns is unpredictable. How can you measure exactly 45 minutes.






//     If you find the solution, work on the second logic puzzle.
//     THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY DOORS
// You are trapped in a room with two doors. One leads to certain doom and the other leads to freedom. You don’t know which is which. There are two robots guarding the doors. They will let you choose one door but upon doing so you must go through it. You can, however, ask one robot one question. The problem is one robot always tells the truth ,the other always lies and you don’t know which is which.
//     What is the question you ask?
//     HINT: Each robot knows everything about the other robot.
